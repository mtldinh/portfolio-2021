  <h3>Vietnamese Student Association at NC State</h3>

  <div class="container about-container">
    <p>The Vietnamese Student Association (VSA) at NC State is a non-profit organization intended to spread awareness of
      Vietnamese culture within NCSU. VSA hosts several events throughout the year, such as Vietnamese language lessons,
      community socials, and general body meetings. Most notably, VSA creates an annual Vietnamese cultural showcase “Viet
      Night,” displaying art forms intertwined with a Vietnamese American story. VSA at NC State is an affiliated school
      of the Mid-Atlantic Union of Vietnamese Student Associations.
    </p>

    <p>
      This academic year, I will be a co-family leader for VSA. A family leader is a personal and academic mentor
      for incoming students that participate in VSA. I also will be serving on the
      script committee for the 2022 Viet Night.
    </p>

    <p>I was a member of the script committee of the 2020-2021 Viet Night. The final product can be seen on
      YouTube, linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLv3D1J3X8" target="_blank">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>I briefly served as a member of the A/V committee for the Mid-Atlantic Union of
      Vietnamese Student Association (MAUVSA). Every year, MAUVSA hosts a Vietnamese youth
      conference, which has over 500 attendees. The conference was cancelled due to COVID-19.
    </p>

    <p>I was a general body representative, or a freshman intern, on the 2019-2020 executive board. During my time as a representative:
    </p>

<ul>
  <li>I contributed to writing the script for Viet Night, within the script committee.
  </li>

  <li>I communicated technical needs for Viet Night and that year’s charity ball, within the technical committee.
  </li>

  <li>I shadowed other eboard members and picked up required tasks.
  </li>

  <li>I co-created a general body meeting about Vietnamese ethnic minorities.
  </li>

  <li>I strengthened my networking skills within the Asian American community in Raleigh.
  </li>
</ul>


    <p>VSA at NC State is one of the first communities at NC State I encountered as a first-year. I love the
      culture, people, and opportunities I’ve met through the organization! I will continue to participate in the
      organization throughout my time as a college student.
    </p>
