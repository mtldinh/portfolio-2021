  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <div class="container about-container">

    <img src="images/me_photo.jpg" id="selfie" alt="photo of Minh-Thu" width="350px">

    <p>Hi! My name is Minh-Thu Dinh (she/her). It's pronounced min, like minute, and then two, like the number two.
      My last name follows the same sound as the Minh part.</p>

    <p>I am born in North Carolina and I've lived in North Carolina for all my life. I've mostly been based in
      the Charlotte area, but I have lived in Durham and currently am living in Raleigh to attend
      NC State University. I also will be in Raleigh while pursuing a summer internship for Eaton, a power management company.</p>


    <p>I am majoring in electrical engineering and am pursuing a minor in theatre.</p>

    <p>
      <em>Why electrical engineering?</em>
        For a combination of reasons! I did basic sound design in high school for musical theatre productions (hence the minor)
        and was fascinated by the electrical transmission of sound.
        I loved building circuits in my Project Lead the Way classes. My dad previously worked as a fire alarm
        technician for my school district and our conversations about his work piqued my interest. I really enjoy the flexibility within the major.
        I also enjoy the course material and labs offered at NC State.
    </p>

    <p>If you want to find out more about my technical skills within electrical engineering, you can check out my resume in the top right corner!</p>

    <p>Beyond my career goals, I also am invested in Asian American advocacy and community. Ever since high school, I've been intensely involved
      in Asian American organizations, whether by creating Southeast Asian spaces, volunteering for local communities, or interning at an Asian American non-profit.
      Asian American identity and community is extremely important to me. As a Vietnamese American second-generation woman, I always intentionally consider my space
      and contributions through an intersectional lens.
      I currently am volunteering some time for North Carolina Asian Americans Together and am part of creating an NC State collective for Asian American
      and Pacific Islander students.</p>

      <p>Finally, I am a frequent participant of theatre! I mostly do backstage work and love to help out in any capacity (I am not a fan of acting).
      Due to COVID-19, I have had a hand in script writing (seen <a href="https://fb.watch/5qttka4MUR/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLv3D1J3X8" target="_blank">here</a>), but have worked before as an assistant stage manager, run crew member, sound board technician, and set worker.
      I currently intend to participate at my university's theatre program and Raleigh Little Theatre.</p>

    <p>A bit of a story to read, but I hope that you have gotten to know me more with the information above! Thanks for reading!</p>
