<p><em>Introduction</em></p>
    <p>Hi! My name is Minh-Thu Dinh (she/her). It's pronounced min, like minute, and then two, like the number two.
      My last name follows the same sound as the Minh part.</p>

    <p>I am born in North Carolina and I've lived in North Carolina for all my life. I've been based in Charlotte, Durham, and now, Raleigh!
      I am majoring in electrical engineering, but have interests in Asian American advocacy and theatre.</p>

    <p><em>Electrical Engineering</em></p>
      <p>Why did I choose to pursue electrical engineering? For a combination of reasons! I did basic sound design in high school for musical theatre productions (hence the minor)
        and was fascinated by the electrical transmission of sound.
        I loved building circuits in my Project Lead the Way classes. My dad previously worked as a fire alarm
        technician for my school district and our conversations about his work piqued my interest. I also love handling the logistics, especially with concepts
         as large as power systems.
</p>

    <p>If you want to find out more about my technical skills within electrical engineering, you can check out my resume in the top right corner!</p>

<p><em>Asian American Advocacy</em></p>
    <p>Beyond my career goals, I also am invested in Asian American advocacy and community. Ever since high school, I've been intensely involved
      in Asian American organizations, whether by creating Southeast Asian spaces, volunteering for local communities, or interning at an Asian American non-profit.
      Asian American identity and community is extremely important to me. As a Vietnamese American second-generation woman, I always intentionally consider my space
      and contributions through an intersectional lens.
      I currently am volunteering some time for North Carolina Asian Americans Together and am part of an NC State collective for Asian American students.</p>

<p>
  <em>Theatre</em>
</p>
      <p>Finally, I am a frequent participant of theatre! I mostly do backstage work and love to help out in any capacity (I am not a fan of acting).
      Due to COVID-19, I have had a hand in script writing (seen <a href="https://fb.watch/5qttka4MUR/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oLv3D1J3X8" target="_blank">here</a>), but have worked before as an assistant stage manager, run crew member, sound board technician, and set worker.
      I will be volunteering at University Theatre throughout my time at NC State</p>

    <p>A bit of a story to read, but I hope that you have gotten to know me more with the information above! Thanks for reading!</p>
